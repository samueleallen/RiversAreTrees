Fun Facts

Right Tributaries
"Yakima" 	    "Lewis and Clark mention in their journals that the Chin-nâm pam (or the Lower Snake River Chamnapam Nation) called the river Tâpe têtt(also rendered Tapteete), possibly from the French tape-tête, meaning "head hit"."
"Wenatchee" 	"Water from the Wenatchee River and its tributaries has been diverted for irrigation since 1891, mainly for orchards."
"Entiat" 	    "The river's name is derived from the Columbia-Moses (Salishan) term, meaning "place of grassy water"; another source states that it was called Enteatqua which means "Rapid Water" or "Rushing Water." The name, spelled "Entiat", was selected for the river in 1958 by the Chelan County Public Utility District."
"Chelan" 	    "Nearly the entire river's flow is diverted to the Lake Chelan Powerhouse, 3.9 miles (6.3 km) downstream near the river's mouth. Thus the Chelan River is almost always dry."
"Methow" 	    "The Methow's watershed is characterized by relatively pristine habitats, as much of the river basin is located in national forests and wildernesses."
"Okanogan" 	    "From Oroville the Okanogan River flows south through the Okanogan County, past Okanogan and Omak. It forms the western boundary of the Colville Indian Reservation."
"Nespelem" 	    "It is completely contained within Okanogan County and the Colville Indian Reservation. The name "Nespelem" is said to come from the Indian word nesilim, meaning "flat land"."
"Sanpoil" 	    "The name is from the Okanagan term [snpʕʷílx], meaning "people of the gray country", or "gray as far as one can see"."

"Snake"         "About 1,080 miles (1,740 km) long, it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, which is the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean."
"Crab Creek"    "It is sometimes referred to as the "longest ephemeral stream in North America"."
"Spokane" 	    "The Spokane River contains some of the highest concentrations of heavy metals of any river in the state, resulting from pollution coming from Lake Coeur D'Alene."
